# com.walmartlabs/pedestal-lacinia

A library that adds the Pedestal underpinnings needed when exposing
[Lacinia](https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia) as an HTTP endpoint.

## Usage

For a basic Pedestal server, simply supply a compiled Lacinia schema to
the `com.walmart.lacinia.pedestal/pedestal-service` function to
generate a service, then invoke `io.pedestal.http/start`.

Lacinia will handle GET and POST requests at the `/graphql` endpoint.

When the `:graphiql` option is true, then a
[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) IDE will be available at `/`.

Alternately, you can build you own stack and re-use the individual pieces
supplied here as building blocks.
The steps for processing a GraphQL query are broken into multiple steps:
- Extracting the query string and query variables from the request
- Verifying that a query was included in the request
- Converting the query string to a parsed query
- Executing the parsed query
- Setting the response status
- Encoding the response body as JSON

Each of these steps is its own Pedestal interceptor.

#### Clients

For GET requests, query parameter `query` should be the query to execute.

For POST requests, the content type should be `application/graphql` and the
body of the request should be the query to execute.

In both cases, query variables may be supplied.  The `variables`
query parameter should be the string-ified JSON containing the variables.

The response type will be `application/json`.

#### Response Status

Response status is normally 200.

If the :data key is missing, that indicates a bad request (a failure
during query parse or prepare), and so
the response status is set to 400.

However, you can get more precise control over the response status.
A field resolver function may use the `resolve-as` function to return
an error map.
An error map with a :status key is used to set the overall response
status.
The :status value is expected to be numeric.

Typically, you would use this when a field resolver uses an external
resource (a database, or another web service) and that resource
fails; the field resolver can determine an appropriate HTTP status
and include it with an error map.

The response status is the maximum of any :status value of any
error map.

The :error key is `dissoc`'ed from the error maps in the response.

### GraphiQL

The GraphiQL packaged inside the library is built using `nvm`, from
version `0.9.3`.
